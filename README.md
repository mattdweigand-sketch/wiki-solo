# <Organization> Wiki

A clonable, agent-readable wiki template for company, project, or personal context layers, built on the [Karpathy LLM-wiki pattern](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f).

Source documents go into `raw/`. The AI reads them once and incrementally builds a structured, cited, interlinked wiki in `wiki/`. Downstream agents read the wiki to answer questions about the context owner: a company, team, project, person, body of work, decisions, goals, source material, and operating context.

## Why this exists

Most AI stacks re-retrieve context on every query (RAG). Context never compounds.

This wiki inverts that. The AI reads a source once, integrates it into a persistent structure, and throws the retrieval cost away. Future queries hit maintained pages with citations, cross-references, contradictions, and synthesis already in place.

---

## Getting Started

1. Point any agent at the repo. Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md` automatically; ChatGPT, Codex, Cursor, or a raw API harness start at `AGENTS.md`.
2. If this is a fresh clone, run [`SETUP.md`](SETUP.md) to configure `wiki/domain.md`.
3. Drop a source into `raw/` and say "ingest."
4. Ask questions: "What do we know about X?"

Sources live in `raw/`. Synthesized pages live in `wiki/`. Agents use `AGENTS.md`, `wiki/domain.md`, and `CONTEXT.md` to route each task into the right workflow.

## Agent Setup Prompt

Copy this into your coding agent to download and configure a local wiki from this template:

```text
Download https://github.com/mattdweigand-sketch/wiki-solo locally as a new wiki folder.

Ask me what the local folder should be named and where to put it. Then clone or download the repo, enter the new folder, and read AGENTS.md. Because wiki/domain.md starts as status: unconfigured, follow SETUP.md to configure the wiki for my organization, project, or personal context.

After setup, run the repo checks:
- python3 scripts/wiki_eval.py
- python3 scripts/lint.py --tier1

Report the files you changed, whether the checks passed, and any follow-up choices I need to make.
```

The repo has six common commands. Claude Code and Codex expose them as slash commands; other agents reach the same workflows through `CONTEXT.md`.

| Command | Use it to |
|---|---|
| `/wiki-ingest` | Turn a raw source into durable wiki pages. |
| `/wiki-capture` | Record first-person context, usually a decision or lived experience. |
| `/wiki-promote` | Route a useful artifact into the wiki, or decide not to save it. |
| `/wiki-lint` | Run deterministic checks, judgment candidates, and evidence review. |
| `/wiki-synthesize` | Draft corpus distillations for review and approved promotion. |
| `/wiki-export` | Build a zip backup of the wiki, including raw sources. |

Ask questions in plain language. Research answers can stay in chat or become analyses when they should be durable.

## Configuration

A fresh clone starts unconfigured. `SETUP.md` interviews the user for the context owner, domain, active entity types, custom entity types, `raw/` taxonomy, and example questions. The active entity set lives in [`wiki/domain.md`](wiki/domain.md). The full schema lives in [`wiki/SCHEMA.md`](wiki/SCHEMA.md).

The old no-write harness is archived under `archive/wiki-harness/`. Ordinary ingest does not run a harness preflight.
